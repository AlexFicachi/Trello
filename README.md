This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

This ReactJS app includes dynamic functionality such as:
<ul>
  <li>add column</li>
  <li>add card</li>
  <li>delete column</li>
  <li>delete card</li>
  <li>edit column name</li>
  <li>edit card name</li>
  <li>drag and drop cards</li>
</ul>

react-beautiful-dnd was used for the drag and drop functionality.

All CSS is my own custom made CSS using styled-components, using the trello.com design as a design spec.

The component folder hierarchy is organized so all components specific to cards can be found in the card folder, as well as for the column foler, addlist folder (the button that is responsible for adding a new list/column), header folder, & the shared folder which includes components that are reused throughout the application.
